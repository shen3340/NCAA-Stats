This repository contains images of visualizations I have created in R. 

- NCAA Top 10 Game Score
  - This visualization includes the Top 10 Individual Game Performances in College Basketball over the past week, according to Game Score. Game Score was created by John Hollinger to give a rough measure of a player's productivity for a single game. The formula was mainly created for NBA games, so I haven't adjusted the formula to correctly reflect NCAA games.
